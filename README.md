* Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
* It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, but in Django, it is referred to as the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern.
* Django is designed to help developers build web applications quickly, efficiently, and maintainably.
* Its batteries-included philosophy and strong conventions make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.
* Whether you are building a small project or a large-scale application, Django provides the tools and structure to streamline the development process.
