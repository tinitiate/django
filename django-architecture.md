# Django project architecture
* Below is the basic folder / file structure of a Django Project
```
projectname/
│
├── manage.py
├── projectname/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── asgi.py
│
└── appname/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── migrations/
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── tests.py
    └── views.py
```

* **projectname/** The main project folder.
  * **manage.py** Command-line utility for interacting with the project.
  * **projectname/** The inner project folder with the same name as the project.
  * **__init__.py** An empty file indicating that this directory should be treated as a Python package.
  * **settings.py** Configuration settings for the project.
  * **urls.py** URL patterns for the project.
  * **asgi.py** Configuration for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface).
* **appname/** An app within the project.
  * **__init__.py** An empty file indicating that this directory should be treated as a Python package.
  * **admin.py** Configuration for the Django admin interface.
  * **apps.py** Configuration for the app.
  * **migrations/** Database migration files.
  * **__init__.py**: An empty file indicating that this directory should be treated as a Python package.
  * **models.py** Defines the data models for the app.
  * **tests.py** Unit tests for the app.
  * **views.py** Defines the views (functions or classes) that handle HTTP requests.
  * This is a basic representation, and a Django project can include multiple apps. 
  * The manage.py file is used to perform various tasks such as running the development server, applying migrations, and creating new apps.
  * The settings.py file contains configurations for database connection, middleware, static files, and more.
  * The urls.py file defines the URL patterns for the entire project.

In a real-world scenario, there may have additional folders and files depending on the complexity of the project and the specific requirements.
